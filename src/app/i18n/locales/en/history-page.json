  "getmore-job-title": "FRONT-END DEVELOPER",
  "getmore-job-description": "It was my first internship and then full-time job. I had the opportunity to collaborate not only in software development, but in the business development too, because it was a startup without a well defined product. I was the only front-end developer at my squad and we created a white-label cashback platform from scratch to rent to multiple clients. It was rented to the next bank. I was mentored by a more experienced developer and I saw how important it is. That's why I like to help less experienced developers to improve their skills."
