      "Working at AMARO I was responsible for maintaining features and create new ones on the company's e-commerce. It was my first time working with design system, micro front-ends, web vitals, data analytics and SEO. Had daily experience with error logging and monitoring.

    description:
      "It was my first internship and then full-time job. I had the opportunity to collaborate not only in software development, but in the business development too, because it was a startup without a well defined product. I was the only front-end developer at my squad and we created a white-label cashback platform from scratch to rent to multiple clients. It was rented to the next bank. I was mentored by a more experienced developer and I saw how important it is. That's why I like to help less experienced developers to improve their skills.",
